# Delete Meta Data from PDF file

## Setup
This script requires the ```pdf-redact-tools``` package which can be installed via ```Homebrew```.

If you have ```Homebrew``` installed simply run ```brew install pdf-redact-tools``` and then execute the ```delete_pdf_meta.sh```

If you don't have Homebrew installed I'd suggest running the ```install_dependencies_mac.sh``` which will automatically install ```Homebrew``` and ```pdf-redact-tools```.


## Example
```./delete_pdf_meta.sh /Users/user/Desktop/file.pdf``` will delete all meta data from ```file.pdf```
